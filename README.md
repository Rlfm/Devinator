# Devinator
French High School A-Level project in Python 2.7.
This program is based on the website akinator.com, yet simplier . Here it is Sponge bob who tries to guess which animal you chose amongst a certain list. 
# Details
The programm asks you yes/no questions but also "complex questions" which you answer by a sentence then analyzed by Google Cloud Language API.
The game is playable without pressing any button since it uses Google Cloud's speech-to-text and text-to-speech API to interact with the player. 
After each loop the face made by Sponge Bob will change regarding how close he is to finding an answer ( how many animals removes from the possible list)
